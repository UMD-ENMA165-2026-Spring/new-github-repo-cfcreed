# Choices Made When Creating Repository

- Visibility: The visibility was set to public since it allows everyone to view the repository and the example repository guacamole was set to public.
- Template: No template was chosen since there was no need for a template for this practice repository.
- Add README: No README was added during the creation of the repository since it can always be added later as necessary.
- Add .gitignore: This was not enabled due to a lack of need and an unfamiliarity of what .gitignore does.
- Add license: The MIT license was added to practice using a license and also because the guacamole repository used the MIT license.
